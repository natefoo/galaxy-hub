# usegalaxy.org Reference Data

[usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) ([Main](/src/main/index.md) is home to over 4 TB of reference data. This is
comprised mainly of genome sequence builds and associated prebuilt indexes for the tools installed on usegalaxy.org, as
well as the Galaxy-specific configuration files that make the data known to those tools. Because preparing this data for
your own **[local](/src/admin/get-galaxy/index.md)** Galaxy server or an external application can be a laborious
process, we have made this reference available from a variety of schemes.

## Data Structure

There are two primary directories in the reference data repository:

* [/managed][data-managed]: Data generated with [Galaxy Data Managers][data-managers], organized by data table (index
  format), then by genome build.
* [/byhand][data-indexes]: Data generated prior to the existence/use of Data Managers, manually curated. For legacy
  reasons, this directory is shared as [/indexes][data-indexes] on the HTTP and rsync servers.

These directories have somewhat different structures:

* **/managed** is organized by index type, then by genome build (Galaxy **dbkey**)
* **/byhand** is organzied by genome build, then by index type

Both directories contain a `location` subdirectory, and each of these contain a `tool_data_table_conf.xml` file:

* [/managed/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml](http://datacache.galaxyproject.org/managed/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml)
* [/byhand/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml](http://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml)

Galaxy consumes these `tool_data_table_conf.xml` files and the `.loc` "location" files they reference. The paths
contained in these files are valid if the data is mounted via CVMFS.

Examples of data include:

* [twoBit][twobit] (`.2bit`) and FASTA (`.fa`) sequence files
* [Bowtie 2][bowtie2] and [BWA][bwa] indexes
* [Mutation Annotation Format][maf] (`.maf`) files
* SAMTools FASTA indexes (`.fai`)

You can either use the data and Data Table Configuration / location files as-is (with path editing to fit your
environment), or use these as models, or simply move the data into your own custom hierarchy.

## Converting Formats

Most genome sequences in Galaxy are in [twoBit][twobit] format. To convert these to FASTA, use the `twoBitToFa` tool
available from UCSC. There are many common bioinformatics tools to that can be used for file manipulations, but this and
other related tools are in the [UCSC Genome Browser][ucsc] source code [downloads][ucsc-downloads] section.

## Mounting Reference Data with CernVM-FS (CVMFS)

The usegalaxy.org reference data is housed in a [CernVM-FS (CVMFS)][cvmfs] repository that distributes the data in
multiple replicas across the United States and Europe. Because of this, it is possible to directly mount the data
directly on your Galaxy server. CVMFS is a caching, HTTP-based filesystem with a [Linux Filesystem in Userspace
(FUSE)][fuse] (mount) client. FUSE has been a part of Linux since kernel version 2.6.14, so it should already be
available on all modern Linux systems.

When initially mounted, CVMFS does not consume any local disk space on the client (in this case, your Galaxy server).
Instead, as files are accessed, they are pulled from one of the replica (*Stratum 1*) servers to a local disk-based
cache of a configurable size.

Currently, the [Galaxy Docker Image][docker-galaxy-stable] image and [CloudMan][cloudman] images are preconfigured to
mount this data.

### CVMFS Considerations

In order to effectively use CVMFS, you should be aware that the reference data will need to be mounted on both your
Galaxy server and any compute resources (i.e. cluster nodes) on which you will run jobs against that data. Mounting
requires root privileges. CVMFS does provide workarounds for systems where direct mounting is not an option, these are
discussed in the [CernVM-FS on Supercomputers][cvmfs-hpc] documentation.

If you are running more than a small cluster (~5 nodes) and/or are run tools that aggressively access the reference data
with a very small cache, please configure at least a [local proxy][cvmfs-squid], if not a full [Stratum
1][cvmfs-stratum1] (replica/mirror). **Overloading the public Stratum 1 servers can result in a traffic block in order
to maintain service availability.**

Before you begin, it is a good idea to become acquianted with the CVMFS [Overview][cvmfs-overview], [Getting
Started][cvmfs-getting-started] and [Client Configuration][cvmfs-client-config] documentation.

[cvmfs-client-config]: http://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-quickstart.html

### CVMFS Client Configuration

The CVMFS documentation is very thorough, so we do not provide step by step instructions on configuring a client, as
this can be performed simply by following the [Getting Started][cvmfs-getting-started] and [Client
Configuration][cvmfs-client-config] documentation.

Once installed, you should be able to run `cvmfs_config` to perform the basic CVMFS setup, then add the Galaxy-specific
configuration with the following files:

**/etc/cvmfs/default.local**
```bash
CVMFS_REPOSITORIES="data.galaxyproject.org"
CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY="DIRECT"
CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT="4000"    # the cache size in MB
CVMFS_USE_GEOAPI=yes        # sort server list by geographic distance from client
```

**/etc/cvmfs/domain.d/galaxyproject.org.conf**
```bash
CVMFS_SERVER_URL="http://cvmfs1-tacc0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/@fqrn@;http://cvmfs1-iu0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/@fqrn@;http://cvmfs1-psu0.galaxyproject.org/cvmfs/@fqrn@;http://galaxy.jrc.ec.europa.eu:8008/cvmfs/@fqrn@"
```

**/etc/cvmfs/keys/data.galaxyproject.org.pub**
```pub
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

owIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Once configured, you should be able to access the data with `cd /cvmfs/data.galaxyproject.org`. You may need to restart
AutoFS first with `systemctl restart autofs` (the exact command depends on your specific Linux distribution and
release).

The configuration given above is a minimum, please consult the CVMFS documentation to further tune your client.

### Galaxy Configuration

In `galaxy.yml` (`galaxy.ini` in older Galaxy Releases), configure the paths to the `tool_data_table_conf.xml` files
with the `tool_data_table_config_path` option in the `galaxy:` (`[app:main]` if using the ini file) section:

```yaml
galaxy:
    tool_data_table_config_path: /cvmfs/data.galaxyproject.org/byhand/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml,/cvmfs/data.galaxyproject.org/managed/location/tool_data_table_conf.xml,config/tool_data_table_conf.xml
```

Once your Galaxy server has been restarted, you should see the reference data in the tools that use them.

### CVMFS Server Details

The list of Stratum 1 servers for the `data.galaxyproject.org` CVMFS repository currently include:

| Server | Host | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cvmfs1-psu0.galaxyproject.org` | [Galaxy Project][galaxyproject] | [Penn State University][psu], Pennsylvania, USA |
| `cvmfs1-iu0.galaxyproject.org` | [Galaxy Project][galaxyproject] via [XSEDE][xsede] | [Jetstream Cloud][jetstream] at [Indiana University][iu], Indiana, USA |
| `cvmfs1-tacc0.galaxyproject.org` | [Galaxy Project][galaxyproject] via [XSEDE][xsede] | [Jetstream Cloud][jetstream] at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center][tacc], [University of Texas at Austin][utexas], Texas, USA | 
| `galaxy.jrc.ec.europa.eu:8008` | [European Commission Joint Research Centre][jrc] | Ispra, Italy |

The full path to the repository, e.g. for use in the `CVMFS_SERVER_URL` configuration parameter, where `<SERVER:[PORT]>`
is one of the servers above and `<REPO>` is the CVMFS repo name, is:

```
http://<SERVER:[PORT]>/cvmfs/<REPO>
```

The reference data repo name is `data.galaxyproject.org`, but for use in `CVMFS_SERVER_URL`, you should use `@fqrn`, as
CVMFS templates the repository name in to the URL for you.

## Obtaining Reference Data with Rsync or HTTP

In addition to directly mounting the data, it can be fetched with [Rsync][rsync] or over the web using HTTP.  Rsync is a
particularly useful tool for this as it is able to both recursively retrieve data, as well as skip data that is already
present on the local side that has not changed.

The [Rsync Data Manager][rsync-dm] also fetches data from the reference data rsync server.

The `rsync` command line tool is often preinstalled on many popular Linux distributions, but if it is not available, it
can be intalled via the system package manager, usually with the package name `rsync`. Consult your distribution's
documentation for help.

[rsync]: https://rsync.samba.org/
[rsync-dm]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/data_managers/data_manager_rsync_g2

### Rysnc Server Name

```
datacache.galaxyproject.org
```

The server was also formerly referred to as `datacache.g2.bx.psu.edu`, which remains an alias to
`datacache.galaxyproject.org`.

The datacache server also performs a double duty as the `cvmfs1-psu0` CVMFS Stratum 1 server referenced in the previous
section.

### Example Data Retrieval

To download the complete directory for the **[phiX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_X_174)** genome:

```console
$ rsync -avzP rsync://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/phiX .
```

Note the use of the `-z` flag, which compresses/decompresses data on the fly. This is not crucial for a small genome
such as phiX, but significantly improves network performance for larger genomes. The additional flags are explained on
in the documentation (accessible locally with `man rsync`).

The final argument of `.` means that the data will be transferred to your current directory. You can replace `.` with a
path to control where the data is downloaded to:

```console
$ rsync -avzP rsync://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/phiX /data/genomes
```

Most of the baterical genomes are nested one directory down in
[/indexes/microbes](http://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/microbes). Thus, to fetch the sequence and indexes for a
microbe, use a command like the following, where `63` is the assigned **dbkey** for the NCBI genome accession
`NC_007622`, sourced from UCSC, and listed under GUI Genome Builds as **Staphyloccus aureus RF122 (63)**. For any
genome, the dbkey is the value (inside_here) of its UCSC name.

```
$ rsync -avzP rsync://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/microbes/63 .
```

### Organization and DBKEY

Genomes are organized in directories by reference genome **dbkey**. If you are not sure of the **dbkey**, it can be
found in the [Main](/src/main/index.md) user interface. This value is what is populated into the *"database"* attribute
for a dataset. Or, it is the last value in parenthesis *(dbkey)* at the end of the full reference genome build name in
two specific places in the [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/) interface:

**Example: dbkey 'Tcas_3.0'**

* *On **Get Data -> Upload File** tool:* <br />![](/src/admin/use-galaxy-rsync/dbkey_UploadFile.png)
* *Under **Edit Attributes** (found by clicking on any dataset's upper right corner pencil icon):* <br />![](/src/admin/use-galaxy-rsync/dbkey_EditAttributes.png)

## Location (*.loc) Files

To retrieve an exact copy of the `.loc` files used by the tools on **[usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org)**, execute these rsync commands:

```
$ rsync -avzP rsync://datacache.galaxyproject.org/indexes/location/ location/byhand
$ rsync -avzP rsync://datacache.galaxyproject.org/managed/location/ location/managed
```
